# SHOWTIME
It is a solution that allows you to view and buy tickets for different events.
If you are looking for an easy way to book your tickets, you have come to the right place.
"The application is still under development"

## HOW IT WORKS
Any user can view the different events by entering the site without being registered.
In order to be able to buy a ticket, the user must create an account with his login details.
Once the account is created, he will be able to access the market and buy tickets.

## ARCHITECTURE
The website contains different features.
The main page displays all the concerts, it also has a search bar which allows you to filter the search.

From the header it is also possible to log in, log out or register and return to the main page.
It is possible to display more information about a concert by clicking on the reservation button.
The reservation button will send you to the page that will allow you to buy or not a ticket.

All registered users can modify their email or password.
